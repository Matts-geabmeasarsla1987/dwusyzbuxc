Omg, just finished Hurry Up Tomorrow and like... wow, what a trip. Seriously, that plot twist though! Okay, maybe Iâ€™m exaggerating a bit, but it was a wild ride for sure. Like, why do they always make the villains so charming?? I was low-key rooting for them, which is probs not great, you know what I mean? ðŸ˜‚

And can we talk about the makeup looks?? Absolutely stunning. I swear, I was trying to figure out which products they used throughout the whole movie. Itâ€™s giving vintage glam meets futuristic vibes, if that makes any sense. You know Iâ€™m gonna try to recreate some of those looks tomorrow, after I get like, my third coffee.

> Oh, and the way it ended! I was like, wait, what just happened? Haha, maybe I shouldâ€™ve downloaded the movie and watched it again before messaging you, right? Itâ€™s one of those that you need to see twice to catch everything going on. Or maybe my brainâ€™s just too sleepy to keep up rn lol.

Anyway, did NOT see that ending coming, but isnâ€™t that the point? Like, yay for creativity or whatever. But srsly, that last scene, I was left hanging. Speaking of scenes, the music had me bobbing my head more than actually focusing, not gonna lie. ðŸŽ¶

Some random C# code: `int totalConfusion = plotTwist + coffeeLack;` haha donâ€™t ask me why I wrote that.

Okay, Iâ€™m gonna crash now. Brain = mush. Letâ€™s catch up tomorrow? I can give you more deets and maybe we can actually watch the movie together. Catch ya later! ðŸ˜´
